<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I can't exactly pinpoint the date and time but it undoubtedly took   place during my one-hour commute home from work one day. It probably was a run of the mill workday: 9 hours, no lunch break, sitting in my cubicle wearing my headset and falling into hypnosis due to the blinking lights on my call box and the persistent glow from Microsoft Outlook's notification pop-up on my monitor. A moment where I, someone who likes to think of themselves as eccentric and unique, fell prey to a perfect storm of cliches that resonated within me with such lucidity.</p>

<p>But before all that happened I was a bouncing baby boy born and raised in the sunny state of Florida. I grew up in front of the TV and had the itch to be on the other side of the screen at an early age. I remember in grade school ruining a globe by scribbling a fictional storm in the Atlantic and mock forecasting it's projected path with a permanent marker in front of all my classmates. As things progressed, athletics and competition began to mold my passion and personality. In middle school and into high school I relished being in the spotlight, be it stage or stadium. Whether it was those moments emceeing school events or playing the sport du jour, I was in my element in front of a crowd telling stories or competing.</p>

<p>Then I entered the fabled halls and arenas on the campus of The Florida State University. It was here where autumn afternoons in Saturday showed me not only how much I valued sports, but their impact on friends, neighbors, and communities. Whether on I-95 South in Miami or I-95 North in Boston, deep in the South in Louisiana or in the expansive cornfields of the Midwest and South Bend, Indiana, I witnessed the magnitude sporting events had on people of all walks of life. As a fan myself I also consumed all the sports programming I could and started pondering the possibility of pursuing a career as an on-air sports personality. After all, I was confident in my ability to produce and craft the stories fans cared about and felt I had the knack to connect and entertain a wide patchwork of viewers. Yet, I found myself elbow deep in an unrelated major and began questioning the feasibility of making my hobby into a career.</p>

<p>However, after squeezing a fun-filled fifth autumn out of my college experience and experiencing lingering doubts of what my next step should be, I took a leap of faith of sorts. As an avid fan I was familiar with a local website affiliated with Rivals.com which focused solely on Florida State athletics. A subscription to the website, Warchant.com, was burning a hole in my pocket, so I figured what the heck, why not see if I'm cut out for this stuff and give it a go? So for the next 14 months I was a sports reporter following the beat for my alma mater and favorite team. Talking shop with the winningest coach in major college football history and enjoying the air conditioning and free food of press box seats. I had gone into the experience fully cognizant of what my viewers and subscribers wanted from their coverage, but now I was able to utilize my interpersonal strengths to develop important contacts and learn the ropes of working the beat. It was a priceless experience that gave me the "foot in the door" break and allowed me to see the limitations of the pen and how I truly wanted to work cross-platform and be in front of the cameras to bring my energy and spirit into the homes of the passionate sports communities.</p>

<p>However, at the end of the day the job was temporary, bills needed to be paid and I relocated back to the Tampa Bay area. So out there I went, into the real world and onto that 40-hour job and all it's wonderful trappings. It wasn't before too long that the drudgery of my week took its toll, and it was on one of those early evenings crossing Tampa Bay on my way home where it all hit me. How money wasn't everything and you have to love what you do for a living. Ok, so the writing gig paid peanuts, but the joy of going to work was priceless. I learned that nothing good comes easy. Despite my confidence, I had some natural doubt about the tough sledding that could lie ahead pursuing a career in sports broadcast but I now knew what I needed to do for a living. I knew what I was capable of doing for a living, and I needed to put forth a plan to achieve that. This website is a small part of that plan. The next is joining your community and doing what I love to do. Telling the captivating stories that bring people together, being the eyes, ears, and voice of for people just like myself who love their town and their sports. If you haven't done so, please take a moment to view my reel and contact information. Thanks for allowing me to discuss my story and present my talent.</p>
